# Untitled Ti calculator Rogue-like
[Game](./Games.md) | [TI BASIC](./TiBasic.md) | [2016](./2016.md)

A simple text-based rogue-like where you faced random enemies in turn-based battles. Each enemy becoming increasingly stronger.

This game was very popular within my high-school promotion, which motivated me to create more games.

Sadly it is now totally lost because the memory of the TI calculator was very limited, and also because I was not wise enough to save it somewhere else.
