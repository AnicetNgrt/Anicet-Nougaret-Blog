My first released game!

I made this using Unreal Engine 4's "no code" blueprints system. Barely knew how to code back then. But I still got hooked by game development. Designing the gameplay, building an art direction, implementing, sound design and even marketing! 

I got my first experience at working on a project for days without being able to stop. It was truly amazing.
