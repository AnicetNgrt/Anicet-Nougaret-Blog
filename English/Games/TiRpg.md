My first attempt at making a game with true code! (I did a "no code" game before with Unreal Engine 4)

It was a very simple text-based Role Playing Game. You played as an adventurer who faced random events every turn. Such as turn-based battle with a monster, treasure hunting and shopping for weapons.

This game was very popular within my high-school promotion, which motivated me to create more games.

Sadly it is now totally lost because the memory of the TI calculator was very limited, and also because I was not wise enough to save it somewhere else.
